# Thesis — Modern Approaches in Computer Vision

This thesis explores recent advances in **computer vision architectures**, focusing on convolutional and transformer-based models for feature extraction, image understanding, and efficient training in constrained environments.

⚠️ **Note:**  
Code developed **prior to the thesis** during my internship at **ASINE S.r.l.** is **not publicly available**, as it is company property.  
This repository only includes the research, documentation, and publicly shareable materials produced independently for the thesis.
