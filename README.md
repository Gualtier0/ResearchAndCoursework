# Research and Coursework Portfolio

This repository collects selected projects from my MSc and early research work in **Computational Science**, **Artificial Intelligence**, and **Data Analysis**.  
It includes both individual research efforts and course-related projects demonstrating practical experience across machine learning, NLP, explainability, and data science.

## ⚠️ Notes

- Some notebooks rely on local data paths or course-provided datasets. Outputs are preserved for readability.  
- Large datasets or environment-specific files might be excluded via `.gitignore`. The same applies to sensitive data.
- Each subfolder may include reports, presentations, and rendered notebook outputs.
