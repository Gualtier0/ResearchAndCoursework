## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- Some notebooks rely on local data paths or course-provided datasets. Outputs are preserved for readability.  
- Large datasets or environment-specific files might be excluded via `.gitignore`. The same applies to sensitive data.
- Each subfolder may include reports, presentations, and rendered notebook outputs.
