# Relational Event Modeling of Invasive Insect Species Dynamics

This project applies **Relational Event Models (REMs)** to analyze temporal interaction patterns in an invasive insect species dataset, modeling how environmental and spatial factors influence the spread process.

The resulting poster was presented at the **Workshop: Innovation in Dynamic Network Modelling**.
